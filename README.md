# Munster Skywatchers 
The Munster Skywatchers website was designed with astronomy enthusiasts in mind as a way to link up people with a similar interest with a view to meeting up every few weeks for night sky watching events where they can meet up for coffee and view scheduled events in the night sky. Whilst using Munster as its base for sky watching events, it is open to all who are interested in signing up to join the group. The purpose of the meet ups is to educate group members on the various objects and events that are happening within our solar system and beyond. There is also a social aspect to the gatherings with coffee meet-ups as a form of meet and greet which is very helpful for new members to the group, along with the outlining of the importance of safety as meet-ups generally take place in one of four locations at night throughout the Munster region.

Both the navbar and footer are common features to the website giving a simple flow to the user experience as they navigate the website.

    The footer contains four social media links to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube, all of which open in a new tab when clicked by the user. On devices such as tablets, laptops and Desktops, the gold hover effect keeps the user interface colouring in line with the themed color scheme used across the site, making the user experience more intuitive.

### Home Page (Landing page)
The index.html or landing page uses a high resolution hero image of the moon to engage the visitor and demonstrate the kind of detail members would experience when viewing celestial objects such as the moon through our telescopes. This page also details more information about what we do, reason to join us and some information on upcoming events in the summer to autumn of 2024.

### Gallery Page
The gallery.html contains a list of images relating to space, the solar system, celestial events and sky watchers with a final image of coffee mugs on a table reminding the user that there is a social aspect to the the sky watch meet ups.
The images are separated by a small white space on mobiles to define the individuality of each image. I opted to keep the enlargened images with a vertical page scroll on larger screen sizes such as laptops and desktops with a ccs overlay descriptive text block which appears and disappears as the user hovers their mouse over each image. I felt that the enlargened images would ensure the high resolution would be more pleasing to the user , visually.

The last page is the joinus.html, where the user gets the opportunity to join the Skywatcher group by completing the form,filling in their Firstname, Lastname, Email, Contact number and selecting Private or Public to notify that they use their own vehicle or public transport when travelling to the Skywatch meet-ups. There is a gold hover effect on each text-input box when the user hovers their mouse over each text-input box to enhance the user experience when interacting with the UI on laptops and desktops. The transparent Join Us button turns green when the users mouse enters the button element on large screens for a more improved, intuitive user experience.
Each text-input box , inluding the radio button options have 'required' attribute that displays an alert promtp to the user if they attempt submit the form without completing these fields.
