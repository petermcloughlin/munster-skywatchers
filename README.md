# Munster Skywatchers 
The Munster Skywatchers website was designed with astronomy enthusiasts in mind as a way to link up people with a similar interest with a view to meeting up every few weeks for night sky watching events where they can meet up for coffee and view scheduled events in the night sky. Whilst using Munster as its base for sky watching events, it is open to all who are interested in signing up to join the group. The purpose of the meet ups is to educate group members on the various objects and events that are happening within our solar system and beyond. There is also a social aspect to the gatherings with coffee meet-ups as a form of meet and greet which is very helpful for new members to the group, along with the outlining of the importance of safety as meet-ups generally take place in one of four locations at night throughout the Munster region.
